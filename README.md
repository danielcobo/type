## ✨ Benefits

- [x] Only a few methods to remember

## 🎒 Requierments

There are no special prerequisites. 

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Install

The examples below will assume you use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

<sub>**Note:** In case you're wondering, **@danielcobo/** is just a [namespace scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes/) - an NPM feature. Scopes make it easier to name modules and improve [security](https://github.blog/2021-02-12-avoiding-npm-substitution-attacks/).</sub>

### Require the module

```js
const fs = require('@danielcobo/type');
```
